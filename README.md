# MathAPI
**Technologies**: Written in Python using FastAPI

**Use**: I wrote this API to be used for my Math Quiz App. This API generates a quiz of 10 math questions based on the math operation you pass in as a parameter. This helps lessen the code I need to write on the front end, since my quiz is now being generated from the back end.
